"Text_tips1":"Squid game is a fun but thrilling simulation game. Published by K Games, it’s a scary simulation game where you get to prank your neighbor. However, that neighbor also happens to be your creepy high school teacher, Miss T. Pranking someone, especially a teacher, might not look nice but Miss T deserves it. She has been very mean to students and has made their lives a living hell while in school.",
"Text_tips2":"So, pranking her at home is a way for your character, the genius girl, to take revenge for her and her classmates. The game will have various levels for you to complete. Each level will require that you complete a certain prank on Miss T to proceed. When you perform a prank, you will also explore Miss T’s house since you need items to do every prank.",
"Text_tips3":"It’s important to not get caught or even be seen by Miss T. If she does, she immediately comes running at you. So, make sure you are exploring the house and doing your prank discreetly. The game will have a small screen at the upper left that will show where Miss T is. Make sure you look at it frequently to see if she is near you or if she’s going back to your location.",
"Text_tips4":"There are already many levels added to Scary Teacher 3D, and each level has a unique prank to complete. But when the game first launched, there were only 13 pranks for you to do. The first one was to add a mousetrap under her magazine (as previously mentioned), and the second one is ruining her breakfast. The 3rd prank involves breaking her TV so she can’t watch her favorite show. You just have to find a tool (a hammer) that you can use to break the TV.",
"Text_tips5":"The 7th prank involves rescuing a cat that Miss T imprisoned inside a cabinet. The 8th is to replace the candle on Miss T’s cake with a firecracker. The 9th one involves putting a big spider inside her book, while the 10th prank will require you to mess with her bath time by adding something to her shampoo. For the 11th prank, you have to cut off the legs of the pool chairs.","Text_tips6":"The 12th prank requires that you mess up Miss T’s fireplace. You will need something to blow it up when she lights a fire. The 13th prank is about ruining Miss T’s bath time. But this time, you will mess with her bathtub.",
